\begin{abstract}

We report on a systematic search through the 2MASS Calibration Point
Source Working Database for systems exhibiting periodic variability.
While the total areal coverage of the data is modest, the temporal
coverage is significant, with more than 100 million 3--band
photometric measurements of 113,030 point sources.  Our sample
represents the most complete compendium of periodic variability in the
near--infrared.  Our data mining efforts recovered {\bf XXX} periodic
systems, which include {\bf XXX} eclipsing binary systems and {\bf
  XXX} radial pulsators -- {\bf XXX} RR Lyrae Type ab, {\bf XXX} RR
Lyrae Type c, {\bf XXX} Cepheids, and one short--period $\delta$ Scuti
star.  Hysteresis in the color--color evolution of these pulsating
systems provides valuable insights into the underlying stellar
astrophysics.  Our search also recovered {\bf XXX} quasi--periodic
long--period variables, which vary on a characteristic timescale, but
whose lightcurves are not repeatable cycle to cycle.  We examine
particularly rich variable star fields including those in $\rho$
Ophiuchus, and in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.  We outline
principles for multi--band periodic variable star classification using
periods and multi--band amplitudes and skews.  This will prove to be a
benchmark reference sample until large area, near--IR time--domain
surveys become a reality.

This includes an initial investigation of the relative importance of
near--IR lightcurve attributes for classification purposes.

%data comes from 2mass-calpswdb, have over 100 million photometric measurements, totaling light curves for 113,030 point objects. we have run supersmoother period folding, ala MACHO, on every light curve. By hand verification used to check. many are found periodic, XX binaries, YY radial pulsators. These include the best sampled light curves for an RR Lyr and Cepheid variables in the NIR, and provide an important benchmark for modeling of these stars. An additional ZZ quasi-periodic variable stars are found. we have also characterized the variability properties as functions of color, finding nearly all objects have ``grey'' variability, where the amplitude is independent of wavelength chosen.

\section{Introduction}
Arguably the two greatest advancements in optical and infrared photometric surveys within the past two decades have been the advent of 1\% accurate multi-wavelength photometry for contiguous portions of the sky exceeding $\Omega\sim10^4$ deg$^2$ \citep[e.g.][]{2mass,wise,dr8a}, and time resolved surveys spanning baselines of days to years  \citep[e.g.][]{ivezic2007,linear}. As both the temporal and spatial domains are explored, new astrophysical phenomena are uncovered, while previously rare events are placed in a statistical context. Naturally, next generation surveys will exploit both of these domains simultaneously, producing deep multi-wavelength surveys with both unprecedented spatial and temporal coverage \citep{panstarrs,lsst}. In order to prepare for these future surveys, which will contain orders of magnitude larger numbers of variable sources, existing catalogs and databases provide valuable insights into the data complexity, and serve as testing grounds for identification and classification of phenomena. Such studies will precipitate the development of new techniques, which in turn may inform the targeting, cadence, and observing strategies of the future surveys \cite[e.g.][]{oluseyi2012}.

%WISE will provide huge variability data in the mid IR for regions near the orbital poles. Many papers using NIR variability to study new physics. The VVV (VISTA variables in the V{\'{\i}}a L{\'a}ctea) survey in the bulge, DR1 just release \citep{vvv_dr1}

The Two Micron All Sky Survey \citep[2MASS;][]{2mass} imaged the full sky in three, simultaneously obtained, near-infrared (NIR) bands. Survey operations were conducted between 1997 and 2001, using a northern and southern telescope. Photometric calibration for 2MASS was accomplished using repeated observations of 35 selected fields, which were spaced across the sky \citep{nikolaev2000}. An additional 5 tiles were imaged around the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds during the last year of operation. Each calibration field covered an area of approximately 8\farcm5 (RA) $\times 1^\circ$ (Dec). The 35 standard calibration fields were scanned ranging between 562 and 3,692 times over the 4 year period, yielding some of the most densely sampled and well--calibrated NIR light curves yet produced. The placement of these tiles is shown in Figure \ref{radec}, and they contain light curves for approximately 110,000 point source objects.  These data were released as part of the 2MASS Extended Mission \citep{cutri2006}, and collectively define the 2MASS Calibration Point Source Working Database (Cal--PSWDB).

\end{figure*}



This unique dataset has been used for a handful of studies to date. 
\citet{plavchan2008a} characterized many of the details in analyzing this unique dataset for time domain studies. They also mined these data for periodic objects, finding 3 new M dwarf eclipsing binaries. 
\citet{plavchan2008b} studied the 131 day periodic object, 2MASS J16271848--2429059, revealing a possible three-body YSO system. 
\citet{sarajedini2009} utilized the images from multiple scans of calibration tile 90067 to produce a NIR color-magnitude diagram for the open cluster M67 that probed $\gtrsim$3 magnitudes deeper than the standard 2MASS point source catalog. 
\citet{becker2008} discovered and characterized a 2.6--day periodic M dwarf binary, 2MASS J01542930+0053266. This system was located in both the 2MASS calibration tile 90004, and the ``Stripe 82'' region of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey footprint, which yielded an 8-band light curve ($ugrizJHK_s$) for the binary. 
Using 16 of the calibration tiles that overlapped the SDSS footprint, \citet{davenport2012} produced some of the first constraints on the properties of M dwarf flares in red optical and NIR bandpasses. 
\citet{parks2013} have conducted a comprehensive study for variability of YSOs in the $\rho$ Ophiuchus star forming region using the Cal--PSWDB light curves. 
Recently \citet{quillen2014} have searched the Cal--PSWDB for red transient variables.





In this paper we present a census of the periodic variable objects from the time--domain calibration data. The data and period-finding methodology are outlined in \S2. We describe the selection and classification of binary stars and radial pulsating objects in \S3. Quasi-periodic and other large amplitude variables that were recovered are discussed in \S4. We examine the general variability characteristics of point sources in the 2MASS calibration scans in \S5, and concluding remarks are given in \S6.

\section{Cal--PSWDB Data}

The properties of the Cal--PSWDB survey have been extensively characterized in \citet{plavchan2008a}. We will briefly describe the survey, and outline our reanalysis of the light curves.

Each night during the main 2MASS survey, the two survey telescopes observed one
of a series of calibration fields every hour with simultaneous $JHK_s$ photometry. These calibration fields were observed with the same ``freeze-frame'' technique used in the entire 2MASS survey, and each calibration field visit produced a 7.8 second exposure. The raw calibration scan imaging was reduced and processed using the standard 2MASS data pipeline\footnote{http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/allsky/doc/explsup.html}.

A total of 35 calibration fields were observed, spread throughout the sky, with between 562 and 3692 epochs. During the final year of the 2MASS survey, five additional calibration fields were observed near the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, which are included in our analysis of variable objects. The location of the 40 calibration fields are shown in Figure \ref{radec}. The Cal-PSWDB contains in total over 196 million point source measurements from 74,772 scans of the 40 calibration fields.


We acquired the entirety of the Cal-PSWDB and LMC/SMC Cal-PSWDB
through a bulk catalog download, and ingested all catalog data into a MySQL
database.  In these original data, the {\tt gcntr} field was used as a
unique identifier for all the merged point--source detections,
i.e. all sources with the same {\tt gcntr} should be associated with
the same astrophysical object.  However, the distributions of
astrometric centroids for a significant number of these objects
appeared multi--model, indicating insufficient object 
deblending at the catalog--level.  For this reason, we performed a wholesale
reanalysis of all of the point source positions, spatially clustering them
into a final set of 113,030 ``objects'' using the {\tt OPTICS}
algorithm \cite{optics}.

For objects brighter than $J=16$, the median number of $J$--band
measurements per object increased from 432 to 671, while the median
RMS of the astrometric centroids modestly decreased to 0.11'' from
0.10'' (when including objects fainter than $J=16$, the median
astrometric RMS decreased from 0.41''to 0.28'').  This indicates that
{\tt OPTICS} both performed a better job of deblending photometry of
nearby objects, and at associating multiple epoch observations of the
same object together.


Following this reclustering, bulk lightcurve metrics were calculated using only
those data with photometric quality flags ``A'' through ``C'',
effectively limiting us to S/N $>$ 5, and corrected photometric
uncertainties smaller than 0.22 magnitudes.  We calculated
per--passband metrics including the error--weighted means and standard
deviations, skew, kurtosis, a reduced $\chi^2$ metric using all the
data, and then a ``robust'' reduced $\chi^2_r$ metric excluding the
brightest and faintest 10\% of points.  The $\chi^2_r$ metric will
thus be less sensitive to single photometric outliers, but will also
be less sensitive to periodic variables whose variability signal lasts
a small fraction of its duty cycle, such as detached eclipsing binary
stars.






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Finding Periodic Variables}

To search for periodically variable objects, we used the {\tt Supersmoother} 
algorithm \citep{supersmoother} that has been used in previous astronomical
datamining applications \citep[e.g.][]{becker2011}.  Data
from each of the three passbands were folded and smoothed independently,
resulting in three independent period estimates per object.

%each light curve was processed with Supersmoother
%objects with periods in at least 2 bands that were not obviously aliases were grabbed (about 2000 objects)
%each light curve was examined by eye, about 250 were bona fide good periodic objects

\subsection{Selection Criteria}
To select systems exhibiting periodic variability, we examined the
periods returned in each of the three passbands.  We applied two sets
of criteria informed by previous multi--band periodic variability
studies.  Because {\tt Supersmoother} will report periods even when
none are supported by the data, all stars in each candidate list were
folded at their suggested periods, and visually inspected to verify
the periodicity of the system, and to classify the sources.

The first selection criterion looks at the fractional uncertainty of
the period estimates, similar to the analysis of
\cite{becker2011}.  Briefly, this requires that the standard
deviation of the period estimates, or of the period estimates
corrected for aliasing, are smaller than $10^{-4}$ of their average
value. This criteria was applied using all 3 periods, and as a looser
cut using only two of the three periods, since the $K_S$--band data
typically have both lower signal--to--noise measurements and smaller
lightcurve amplitudes.  This cut yielded 2073 candidates, each of
which were folded at the reported periods and validated through visual
inspection.  In total 157 systems from this list were verified as
periodic systems.

As noted by \cite{oluseyi2012}, this may present too stringent
of a cut for longer period systems.  Because such systems will have
gone through fewer oscillations in a given time window, their period
is likely to be more poorly constrained.  For this reason, we apply a
second criterion, which requires that the standard deviation of the
periods divided by their squared average is less than $10^{-5} {\rm
  day}^{-1}$.  This set of cuts yielded 696 systems, of which 570 were
new candidates (meaning it recovered 126/157 of the previous objects).
{\bf XXX} of these pass the human validation, and are included in this
publication.



\subsection{Visual Classification}
Each of the {\bf XXX} periodic systems was visually classified based
upon its lightcurve shape, and best--fit period.  These classifications
were roughly based on four categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item Eclipsing binary stars: These lightcurves typically have two
  distinct minima corresponding to the primary and secondary eclipses
  of an edge--on binary system.  These are further subdivided into
  detached and contact W UMa--type systems.  The former have
  relatively flat out--of--eclipse lightcurve and sharp eclipse
  features, while the latter have more sinusoidal shapes and
  continuous variability.  Contact systems may be confused with
  pulsating systems at half the period if the eclipse depths are
  similar.

\item Pulsating variable stars: These lightcurves have a single
  minimum in their variability cycle, with an overall sinusoidal
  lightcurve shape.  Subclasses include Cepheids, RR Lyrae types RRab
  and RRc, and $\delta$ Scu objects.  Subclassifications are made
  based upon period and lightcurve shape.

\item Long period variables: These lightcurves typically have
  timescales of tens to hundreds of days.  Lightcurve features do not exactly repeat, making period estimation difficult.

\item Other: These lightcurve do not fit into any of the categories
  defined above.  Two systems fall into this class, which are explored
  in further detail below.

\end{itemize}





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Eclipsing Binary Stars}
Our by-eye validation of periodic candidates yielded XXX binary stars.
%We found 1XX binaries, need a histogram of their periods. We recover nearly all the binaries from Plavchan's early work (8/23 missed so far)

match to new paper by \citet{parks2013,quillen2014}

to quantitatively separate these things, need a more impartial method. Eclipsing binaries and pulsating variables can be separated and classified by fitting Fourier modes to the light curves \citep{pojmanski2002,nefs2012}. we used similar methods as other authors, using the IDL FOURFIT package by Buie (online CITE/footnote).


the binary type separation has been well-explored, and we use previously established equations (CITE Becker? for example). this puts them in 3 categories, which had excellent agreement with our initial by-eye analysis. we recover XX detached, YY semi-detached objects. contact binaries are called W UMa type, have very sinusoidal light curves. these are difficult to distinguish from rr lyr. sometimes they have color variations, but sometimes not if the mass ratio is near 1.

the separation between binary stars and rr lyrae is more difficult. some types of RR Lyr look very similar to binaries, most especially RR Lyr type a (CHECK ON THIS).  to improve this, we need other types of Fourier cuts to quantify the asymmetry in the light curves. there is some previous work on this (\citep{aaas}?) but we found their cuts didn't make sense, possibly due to different fitting codes (?) or different wavelength(?). 

using our by-eye categorization for objects, 8 for sure pulsators, we explored many combinations of Fourier parameter space. a4/a2 had been suggested previously as a good space to search in \citep{asas}. b1 makes sense, it is the first component of cosine asymmetry from the sinusoidal shape. binaries with eccentricity near 0 should not have any strong b modes. 



To separate binaries from pulsators, we cut on:
\begin{equation}
b_1({\rm binary}) \ge  -0.13\left( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \right)- 0.3
\end{equation}

and different configurations of binaries can be determined using:
\begin{eqnarray}
a_4({\rm detached}) \ge & a_2(0.5 + a_2)\\
a_4({\rm contact}) \le & a_2(0.125 + a_2)
\end{eqnarray}






%\begin{center}
%{\color{red} \line(1,0){250}}
%\end{center}

%things that SUPERSMOOTHER said were periodic in at least 2 bands we looked at, returned 2100 interesting objects. we searched all 2000 light curves of periodic things by eye to pick out the real ones. quite a few are noise. found correct periods by hand, trying folding objects at 1/2, 2, 2/3 etc. also folded at all periods determined for each band.  

%we also put the objects in to 4 classification bins by hand: obvious binaries with distinct eclipses,  objects with very RR Lyr looking saw-tooth light curves, and sinusoidals which could be either W UMa or RR Lyr (a/b?). we also noted quasi-periodic or long period objects whose periods were not well sampled enough to accurately determine. those could be things like Miras, etc. this recovered 160 binaries, 8 pulsators. 25 other things.

\end{figure}





Using our by-hand classification, we can define the best line of delineation between contact and detached eclipsing binaries in this Fourier space. \citet{rucinski1997b} used $a_4< a_2(0.3 + a_2)$ to separate these two populations using OGLE light curves. We had 64 detached, 72 detached by hand classified. We used a brute-force approach to solve for the coefficient $C$ in 
\begin{equation}
a_4 = a_2(C + a_2)\,,
\end{equation}
calculating the fraction of each population correctly classified at each iteration. We used values of $c$ ranging from 0 to 1, in steps of 0.001. The best degree of separation was found for $C=0.334$, yielding 95\% completeness for contact binaries, and 92\% completeness for detached systems.


%the final sample of classified objects were: XX contact binaries, YY semi-detached, ZZ detached, 12 pulsators, and 25 quasi-periodic oddballs. a selection of the LPV/QPVs are given in Figure \ref{ll} (MOVE UP). this matched with total rates of these objects from other surveys?

\section{Pulsators}
Infrared observations of radial pulsating stars was first performed by \cite{wisniewski1968}, and detailed characterization was done for Cepheid variables by \cite{mcgonegal1982} and for RR Lyr variables by \cite{longmore1985}

$K$-band templates first derived in \citet{jones1996}

RR Lyr type variables belong broadly to two classes: RRab and RRc, defined by their light curve morphologies \citep{bailey1902}

\citet{sollima2008} produced $JHK_s$ light curves for the prototypical star, RR Lyr.

limited numbers found in the NIR, usually many few numbers of epochs and phase coverage \citep[e.g.][]{delprincipe2005}


-- outline of section --
these NIR light curves provide benchmarks for several classes of radial pulsating periodic variables. phase coverage is excellent for most of these objects

we have the best Cepheid NIR light curve, best regular RR Lyr, a good $\delta$ Scu, and probably some RR a and RR b types (need to look up difference). this list was matched up against SIMBAD, only XX were previously known about.

No Blazko variables - though should check the known sample to see if any have it and don't show it here.

the list is given in Table X, including distances computed using de-reddened and period-mag relations (CITE)

\subsection{Effects of Shocks}
the light curves can also be folded in to the color-mag space, and medians show kinks. we do this for all the objects.

\section{Automated Classification}

We next describe feature selection of the lightcurves and supervised
learning of the boundaries between the different lightcurve classes.
Feature selection requires reducing the time--series lightcurve to a
set of numbers that summarize its behavior, such as period, amplitude,
and skew.  When initially approaching a problem, it is difficult to
know {\it a--priori} which features are most important for
distinguishing one class of objects from another.  Thus it is typical
to select many features from the lightcurves, and to let the
classifiers determine which are most important.  Similar efforts have
been described for optical lightcurves in the works of
\cite{2008AN....329..288M}, \cite{2011ApJ...733...10R},
\cite{2012MNRAS.427.2917R}, and \cite{LINEAR-3}.

In an analysis of data from the LINEAR survey, \cite{LINEAR-3} use
lightcurve period, amplitude, skew, and color as features for
classification.  As we have 3--band lightcurves, we construct colors
from the median of the $J-H$ and $H-K$ lightcurvse.  We simlarly use
the instantaneous [W1-W2] colors from the WISE survey \cite{wise},
with the cavet that these are acquired at random phases in each
lightcurve.  Lightcurve skews are calculated using the $J$, $J-H$, and
$H-K$ lightcurves, and amplitudes are derived using the 5\% to 95\%
measured range in $J$, $J-H$, and $H-K$.  This yields 1 period, 3
colors, 3 amplitudes, and 3 skews as core lightcurve features.

\cite{asas} find that by Fourier expanding lightcurves using the
series:
\[m(\phi) = A_0 - \sum_{i=1}^4 A_i {\rm cos}(2 \pi i \phi + \varphi) + B_i {\rm sin}(2 \pi i \phi + \varphi)\]
the contact and detached binary systems may be separated out by
looking at the distributions of A$_4$ vs. A$_2$, and the pulsators may
be separated from the contact systems by additionally looking at
B$_1$.  This adds 3 additional features into our input set, yielding a
total of 13.
